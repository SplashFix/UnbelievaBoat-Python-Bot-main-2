# **UnbelievaBoat-like Discord Bot in python**
### For questions about the bot and how to set it up: ask me on Discord at *<kendrik2.0>*

Code is finished, so there won't be any big updates anymore.
But please report any problems to me via Discord !

### - Info
The Bot uses most of UnbelievaBoat's commands for minigames and economy (not moderation tho).
I have actually tweaked it a bit and added things that people suggested. 
#### For a full list, see `src/command_list.txt`.
It emerged from the problem of UB having a balance ceiling and no automated role-income increasing to user's balances.
Obviously it's way bigger now.

### - Goal
The goal was to make an easily customizable Template of a discord bot, also fixing the issues stated above.
Another goal is to have the bot written in python so that it's easy to edit for every user. You can adjust the code so it fits exactly what you need.

### - Install & Use
1. Create a Discord Application for your bot (see https://youtu.be/b61kcgfOm_4, https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. In the Discord Dev Portal, in the "Bot" tab of your application, **enable presence intent, server members intent, message content intent**.
3. Download the code, structured as in this repo.
4. Open the `main.py` file, line 40 and change the **token** to the one of your created bot.
5. If you want log info : In `main.py`, go to line 88 and put a channel ID of the server you want to use the bot in. (Activate Developer Mode Discord to copy channel IDs). This channel will be used to send information about the bot status. Also uncomment line 88, 93, 94, 100 and 109
6. In the `database/database.json` file: scroll down to the symbols part and put a *custom emoji name* in the "symbol_emoji" variable. - for example if you have a bitcoin emoji called "btc". It must be an emoji you uploaded to the server, not a discord-wide one.
7. Invite the bot to your server as shown in https://youtu.be/b61kcgfOm_4
8. Install python3 if you dont have it
9. Install the Discord Api for python3 using pip (`pip install discord.py`)
10. In your server, create a role named "botmaster" and give it to people who should be bot admins.
11. Launch main.py with **python3**. Beware !! On Windows, please use powershell, else path might not be recognized.

You should be good to go!
